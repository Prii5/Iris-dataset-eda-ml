# Iris Data Analysis & Classification
This project performs a complete end-to-end analysis of the famous Iris dataset, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and applying multiple classification algorithms. The goal is to understand the structure of the dataset, uncover patterns, and build predictive models to classify iris species based on floral measurements.

## Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate analysis using histograms, KDE plots, and violin plots

Bivariate analysis using scatter plots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps

Feature engineering: computed PetalArea and SepalArea

Visual comparison of feature distributions across species

## Phase 2: Classification Modeling

Built multiple classifiers including:

        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        Logistic Regression
        Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        Decision Tree
        Random Forest

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualized feature importance from the Random Forest model
